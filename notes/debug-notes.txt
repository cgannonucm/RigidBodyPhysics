To debug with g++ you need to create launch.json tasks.json folder. 
To get dependencies to work
you need to add -I. to two spots in these folders so it looks like this
launch.json
"args": ["-I."],
tasks.json
          	"args": [
                "-fdiagnostics-color=always",
                "-g",
                "${file}",
                "-o",
                "${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe",
                "-I."
            ],
